								Repository -- collection of folders and files - usually we maintain the project source code.
								- Users should always be online to work in the project 
								- If the Central server get currpted/losts, we lose the entire data/project.
						- Distributed VCS 
								- The Remote server maintains the source code repository.
								- Backup of Remote Repositories 
								- Source Code Repository is distributed in all the machines. 
								- Users can have their local copy of the repository and work offline
