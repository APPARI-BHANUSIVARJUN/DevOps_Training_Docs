		-> Business Application : Domain 
				Banking Application
				Finance 
				HealthCare
				Retail
				Insurance 
		
		-> Programming Languages like : Java/Python/.Net ...

					IDE - Eclipse - Integrated Development Environment
					Programming Language - JDK - Java Development Kit
					Source Code Management Tool - GIT
					Web Application Server -- To Execute/Test the Application 
						- Tomcat 
					
					



	Tool: 
		Develop --> IDE - Eclipse,GIT,JDK

	Windows Machine	::
	
	JDK :::
		https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11
			- select window version
		Define Environment Variable in Windows Machine.
			C:\Software\jdk-11\bin
		
	Eclipse :::
		https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
			Choose : Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers  
	
	Tomcat :::
		https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi

			- Demo -- JDK/Eclipse/Tomcat Installation process.
			
				- AWS - Windows Machine .
				
				
			JDK 
			
			Eclipse IDE 
			
			Tomcat 		- Web Application Server - Used to Run Java Web Applications.
			
			
			Discuss about Eclipse IDE 
				- Types of Java Projects ::
				
					Project :::: 
					
						Java Projects :::
						
							*.java ==> Notepad 
							save 
							javac 
							*.class 	==> Executable.
							
						Application :
								Desktop/Console/terminal Application 
									Billing System 
								Web Applications:
									Online Banking 
									E_Commerce
									
							
									
					
				
				- How the Java Applications are created and Build ?
				
						- Using Eclipse IDE
						
						- Java Console Application :
							
				
				
				- Which Build tool is used for build 
				
						Maven Project ::::
						
							Using Maven we can create java project 
							
							Java Project :
								Automate the Code Compilation 
								Create Artifacts 
								Perform Unit Testing 
				
							Maven Project :
								This project is based on Maven Build Tool
								This is to simply the process of code build & unit testing and package/artifacts creation
								It will automatically take care of all the dependencies and plugins needed for application build and testing.
								It used pom.xml file to maintain all the dependencies and plugins needed for application build and testing.
								
								Using the maven project methods, we can create dynamic web applications
								Use the Java Web Application Framework like Springboot.
							
							How Maven Works :
							
								- pom.xml (Project Object Model) ::
										pom.xml file is used to maintain all the dependencies and plugins needed for application build and testing.
								
								- Maven Goals ::
										The objective/Task that are to be performed ::
										
											user_registeration.java program
											Billing.java program
											
												compile 
												test 
												package 
												build 
												clean 
											
									As part of build the package are created and maintained in :
										targets/
											Billing.war / 
											
											*.war 		- Web Archive
											*.jar 		- java Archive 
											
											
								
								- Maven Repsitory -> Is a global/Central Repository from where all the dependencies and plugins are downloaded by maven project during build activity. 
							

						Developer ::
						
							Java web application project :
									Created in my machine. 
										jdk		
										
										eclipse  			- used to create the source code 
										Build Tool 			- to perform build the application
										Unit Testing tool 	- to perform unit testing
																	JUnit 
																	TestNG 
																	Selenium
								
							
							java program :: compiled 
				
				- Maven Build Tool and its capabilities.
	
						Using DevOps Approach :::
							- Create source code Update the code in a source code repository 
							
						DevOps take the responsibility : 
							- Automate build the code 
									Application Build :
										It is process of compiling the source code and creating artifacts.
										Artifacts are - Binaries (*.war,*.jar,*.exec,*.dll)										
							- Automate Create Artifacts
							- Automated unit testing 
							- Automate Promote the code to Testing Environments 
							- Automate the Notification - Notify the testing team to do further testing
					
						Tools : 
							Eclipse based IDEs(Integrated Development Environment) - Eclipse, Pycharm, Intellij
						DevOps Tools ::
							GIT, Jenkins, Build Tools(Maven,JUnit)
							
		goto to start menu :

			select eclipse and launch.

		Maven Goal/Commands 
		Create Java Maven Web Applications using Spring Boot Web Application Framework.	
	
		Maven Build Tool :::
		
		Maven Commands/goal:

		Maven Goals :
			● mvn clean - to clean the target folder.
			● mvn compile - to compile the source code
			● mvn test - to compile and execute junit test cases
			● mvn package - to compile, test and package the application
			● mvn install - to install the package to local repository.
			● mvn deploy - to deploy the package from local repository to remote repository.
			
			
			mvn clean package 
			
				Continuous Integration :::
				
					Dev - created the src code 
					build/create artifacts & promote the code for further testing 
					
			
		Source Repository ==> src/pom.xml 
			Build ==> target/
						*.war
			
		Create Java Console and Web Application :
		
		Java Web Application Project :::
		
			mkdir scripts/
					*.sh 
					
		Maven Project Structure :::			# Java Maven Desktop/Console/terminal Application;

		MVN_Poject1				# Project Name 
			src 
				main			# Maintain the source code *.java - Business Logic 
					*.java
				test			# Maintain the Test Cases and Test Data - JUnit 
					*.java
			target
				artifacts *.war / *.jar
			pom.xml 			==> defines the application artifacts, plugins and all the required depedencies
			
				By using Maven Archetypes
			JRE_Libraries
			MVN_Libraries
	
		Maven Project Structure :::			# Java Maven  Web Application;

		MVN_Poject2				# Project Name 
			src 
				main			# Maintain the source code *.java - Business Logic 
					*.java
					*.java 
					*.java
				test			# Maintain the Test Cases and Test Data - JUnit 
					*.java
			resources
				webapp
					*.html 
					*.jsp
					*.css
			target
				artifacts *.war
			pom.xml 			==> defines the application artifacts, plugins and all the required depedencies
			
				By using Maven Archetypes
			JRE_Libraries
			MVN_Libraries	
			
			
		Eclipse IDE :
		
			Java is Object Oriented Programming Language :
			
			Artifacts ==> JVM - Java Virtual Machine		- Platform Independent Language
							It help to run/execute the java applications in any platform 
								Window/Linux/Mac
			
				OOPs Concepts :
					Class 
							- Functions and Variables.
					Objects
							- Instance of Class 
					Inheritance
					
					Abstraction
					
					Encapsulation
					
		
		
		Create a Java Console & Web Application Using Maven 
		
			1. Create New Project 
			Open Existing Project from the local machine
			Import the Existing Project from external machine/network/repo
			
			
			Archetype :::
			
				Template 
				
			Create a Project ::
				
				*.java 
				
				packages are collection of class/java programs 
		
		Create a Maven Console Application :
				Desktop Application :::	
						Group_ID
							org.apache.maven.archetype
						Artifact_ID
							maven-archetype-simple
						
		Create a Maven Web Application 
						Group_ID
							org.apache.maven.archetype
						Artifact_ID
							maven-archetype-webapp
