DevOps Overview :::

	DevOps :::
	
	Waterfall & Agile Method ??
	
	Stages of DevOps ????
	
	DevOps ::::
	
		- Software --> 
		
			- Application Software 
					--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system
					--> Web Applications       --> ECommerce, Online Banking 
					--> Mobile Applications	   --> Mobile Apps
			- System  Software 
			
		SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle :::
		
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system
				
			- Requirement Analysis 
			- Design 
			- Coding / Development
			- Testing 
			- Implementation 
			- Maintainence/Monitoring
			
		1. Waterfall Model ::: - 	Linear in approach
									It strictly follows top down approach
									It is meant for Monolith Application Architecture
				
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system BASIC / COBOL 
					Billing Application :
						- Inventory Mgmt
						- Price Mgmt
						- User-Interface - CLI
						- Order placement 
						- Payment 
							
				Project 1:		
					- Requirement Analysis 		==> 9 months to complete this project.
					- Design 
					- Coding / Development			mid of 4th Month 
					- Testing 
					- Implementation 
					- Maintainence/Monitoring		
					
				Project 2:		
					- Requirement Analysis 		==> 
					- Design 
					- Coding / Development			
					- Testing 
					- Implementation 
					- Maintainence/Monitoring	

				
				
				Tele-comm Domain :: 
					SP1 --> Introduce a new offer to their customers 
							-> IT Team to implement this ASAP
					SP2 --> 
					
		2. Agile Methodology :::
		
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system BASIC / COBOL 
				
					Billing Application :
						Functions/Modules/Iterations
							- Inventory Mgmt
							- Price Mgmt
							- User-Interface - CLI
							- Order placement 
							- Cash-Payment
							- Online-payment
													
			Iterations 1:  Inventory Mgmt
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***	
		
			Iterations 2:  - Price Mgmt
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***		
	
			Iterations n:  - Online-payment
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***
				
			Using Agile Methodologies we can able to achieve :::
					Continous Development 
					Continous Integration
					Continous Testing 
					Continous Delivery  to Production
								- This Expect Manual approval for Production Release.
			But we cannot achieve :::
					Continous Deployment to Production
								- This Doesnt expect any manual approval for Production Release. We can automate Production Release without any manual intervension.


		3. DevOps :::
		
			What is DevOps ????
			
				DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
				
			
			Teams ::
			
				DevOps Team 
					1. Infra-Structure Management Team 
					2. Application Development Team 
					3. Testing Team
					4. Release Management Team 
					5. Production Support Team
					6. Production Monitoring Team
					7. Security Team
				
				
			Stages of DevOps ::
			
					Infra-Structure Management ::
							IAC - Ansible & Terraform 
							
					Continous Development ::
						- It is capability of Application Development to continously develop the code.
						- Increase the productivity of Developers.
						Developer --> Role of developer ???
							Coding the Business Application.
							- Create source code 
							- Manually build the code 
							- Create Artifacts
							- Manually perform unit testing 
							- Promote the code to Testing Environments 
							- Notify the testing team to do further testing
							
						Using DevOps Approach :::
							- Create source code Update the code in a source code repository 
							
						DevOps take the responsibility : 
							- Automate build the code 
									Application Build :
										It is process of compiling the source code and creating artifacts.
										Artifacts are - Binaries (*.war,*.jar,*.exec,*.dll)										
							- Automate Create Artifacts
							- Automated unit testing 
							- Automate Promote the code to Testing Environments 
							- Automate the Notification - Notify the testing team to do further testing
					
						Tools : 
							Eclipse based IDEs(Integrated Development Environment) - Eclipse, Pycharm, Intellij
						DevOps Tools ::
							GIT, Jenkins, Build Tools(Maven,JUnit)
							
					Continous Integration ::
						- It is capability of Application Development to continously integrate their code change for further testing without waiting for any dependencies.
						
						Tools ::
							- Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes 
						
					Continous Testing ::
						- To enable Automated Testing ::
						- QA Testing
						- UAT Testing 
						
						Tools ::
							- Jenkins, Junit/TestNG/Selenium 						
						
					Continous Delivery  & Continous Deployment
					
						Tools : Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes 
					
						- Both are related to Production Release :
						
						Continous Delivery : 					Continous Delivery  to Production
								- This Expect Manual approval for Production Release.						

								Banking Application :
									Online Banking :::
										release new feature  to Production Environment:::
										
										Open a Production Deployment Window :: (4 - 6 Hrs) - Non-Business Hours
											Take manual approval from all stake holders for this release 
											Thorough Testing in Production Environment.
												If anything goes wrong :
													Fix the Issue. 
													Revert
									
						Continous Deployment :	
								- Can be achieved with the matured DevOps Strategies/Process.
								- This Doesnt expect any manual approval for Production Release. We can automate Production Release without any manual intervension.

					Continous Monitoring :
							
							- Mainly used to achieve Business Continuity.
							
							- Infra-Structure Monitoring
									Monitor the Production Servers -- Memory/CPU utilization & Traffic 
									
							Tools :: 
									Jenkins,Prometheus,Grafana,
									
							- Application Monitoring 
									AppDynamics
									
					
			DevOps Tools ::

				Self Managed - Open Source Tools :
					
				
				Manage Services from Service Providers 
				
					AWS 	
					AZURE 
					GCP
