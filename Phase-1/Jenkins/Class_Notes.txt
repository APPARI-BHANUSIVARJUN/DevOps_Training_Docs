Jenkins - Build Orchestration Tool :::

		DevOps 
		
			Continuous Development 
			
		Jenkin's Is a open source Build Orchestration Tool 
		
			- It is based on Master/Slave Architecture
			
		SDLC : 	
			
			Automated Build 		- Compile & Create artifacts 	 Tool : Maven 
			
			Automated Testing		- Testing - Unit Testing 		 Tool : Junit / Selenium 
			
			Automated Deployment 	- Code Promotion 				 Tool : Docker/Kubernetes/Ansible
			
			Automated Monitoring	- Monitoring CPu/Memory/Traffic  Tool : Prometheus/Grafana

		Jenkin's Is a open source Build Orchestration Tool 
		
			- It is based on Master-Slave Architecture	

			- It is used to automate the process of Continuous Integration/C_Delivery/C_Deployment/C_Testing/C_Monitoring.
			
		Jenkins Architecture:

			Jenkins Master(VM) 	--> Here we install Jenkins,
									Create Jenkins Jobs/Project - CICD Pipeline Projects
									Schedule the Jenkins Jobs in the respective Slave Nodes.
			
				Jenkins Slave Node(VM)	--> Is used to actually perform the application builds
				
				
			@Enterprise level, Application Teams ::::  Team1 - Java Project, Team2 - Python, Team3 - Angular/Nodejs/.net
			
			
			Jenkin_Master (VM)				# Install jdk, jenkins
											# Create Jenkins Jobs/Project - CICD Pipeline Projects
											# Schedule the Jenkins Jobs in the respective Slave Nodes.
											
				Jenkins_Slave_Node1	(VM)	# Build Java Applications 
				Jenkins_Slave_Node2			# Build Python Applications 
				Jenkins_Slave_Node3			# Build NodeJS Applications 
				Jenkins_Slave_Node4			# Build Angular/React Applications 
				Jenkins_Slave_Node5			# Build .Net Applications 
				
				
		Working with Jenkins :::
		
			Jenkins can be used ::
			
				Developer's Perspective :::
				
					- Developers are just the consumers of Jenkins Projects.
				
				
				DevOps Team's Perspective :::
				
					- Jenkins Administrators 
				
					Roles & Responsibilities in Jenkins :::
					
						- Owner of Jenkins Master and Slave Nodes 
						- Complete Administration of Jenkins and its process
						- Installation of jenkins 
						- Management of Jenkins Plugins 
						- User Management 
						- Tools Management
						- Jenkins System Management 
						- Credential Management 
						- Creation and Management of Jenkins Slave Nodes
						- Security/Access Management 
						- Creation of CICD Pipeline Projects 
						- Onboard Application for DevOps CICD Automation 
						- Troubleshooting the issues 
						- Backup and Recovery 
						- Upgrades of Jenkins Servers and Plugins
						
		
		In Jenkins we used groovy as a scripting Language to create CICD Automation.
